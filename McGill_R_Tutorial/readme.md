Welcome! This is an introductory tutorial on R. In this repository, you can access the R scripts (```.R```) for each tutorial. Day 3 also has an ```HTML``` version, so you can visualize the plots. If you have any questions, e-mail me at ```guilherme.garcia@mail.mcgill.ca```.

### Outline

---

##### Day 1 (Sep 8): Fundamentals

- R Basics
- Variables, classes
- Subsetting
- Data frames

##### Day 2 (Sep 15): Working with data

- Loading (and exporting) your data (data frames, data tables)
- Basic functions for exploring your data, renaming columns, subsetting, slice notation
- Examining variables with cross-tabulation (and proportion tables) + very basic plotting with the graphics package
- Summarizing your data with ```ddply()``` (Exploratory Data Analysis, EDA)

---

##### Day 3 (Sep 22): Visualizing data

- Data visualization with ```ggplot()```
- Different plotting functions: boxplots, scatter plots, bar plots, violin plots etc.
- Adding error bars
- Formatting plots (fonts, spacing, colors, annotation, text as variable)

This particular topic also has an ```HTML``` version, where you can visualize all the plots. Click [**here**](http://guilhermegarcia.github.io/resources/intro_to_r/intro_to_ggplot2.html).
