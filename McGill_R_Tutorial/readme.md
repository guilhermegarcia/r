Welcome! This was an introductory tutorial on R organized by me in September 2015. In this repository, you can access all the R scripts (```.R```) used in class. Day 3 also has an ```HTML``` version, so you don't need to run the code to visualize the plots. If you have any questions, e-mail me at ```guilherme.garcia@mail.mcgill.ca```.

- Dates: Sep 8, 15, 22 and 29 (Tuesdays)
- Time: 3:00
- Location: Department of Linguistics, 1085 Dr. Penfield
- Room: 002

### Outline

---

##### Day 1 (Sep 8): Fundamentals

- R Basics
- Variables, classes
- Subsetting
- Data frames

##### Day 2 (Sep 15): Working with data

- Loading (and exporting) your data (data frames, data tables)
- Basic functions for exploring your data, renaming columns, subsetting, slice notation
- Examining variables with cross-tabulation (and contingency tables) + very basic plotting with the graphics package
- Summarizing your data with ```ddply()``` (Exploratory Data Analysis, EDA)

##### Day 3 (Sep 22): Visualizing data

- Data visualization with ```ggplot()```
- Different plotting functions: boxplots, scatter plots, bar plots, violin plots etc.
- Adding error bars
- Formatting plots (fonts, spacing, colors, annotation, text as variable)

This particular topic also has an ```HTML``` version, where you can visualize all the plots. Click <a href="http://www.guilherme.ca/uploads/6/3/0/1/63013285/intro_to_ggplot2.html", target="_blank">**here**</a>.

##### Day 4 (Sep 29): Functions

- Functions, loops and string manipulation
- Regular expressions
- Example: from segments to a CV template
